  <p class="bluetext"><span class="subhead"> Samsung 55" TV</span></br></p>
    I purchased the 65" version to be used in my living room for PC gaming and streaming movies/shows. I picked this TV because has HDMI 2.1 on port 4 and supports 120hz 4K. There are very few sets that are out there currently which have this that actually works as intended. Many advertise it but if you read reviews you will find that it won't be supported until a future firmware update. I also picked this over <i><b>OLED</i></b> because of the risk of screen burn. I spend hours every day with static elements on my screen and will not risk screen burning at this price point. <p class="bluetext"><span class="subhead">This TV also supports variable refresh rate</span><br></p> and is <i><b>AMD Freesync</i></b> compatible.
    It comes with the one connect box which is nice. This is essentially a connection box that you hook all of your devices to instead of connecting a bunch of cable directly to the TV. It is a really nice feature and helps cut down on cable clutter behind the TV. It has 4 HDMI ports. Port 4 is the all important HDMI 2.1 for gaming. You will need to purchase your own HDMI cables. Make sure to get a <i>HDMI 2.1</i> to take advantage of the gaming features.

    <p class="bluetext"><span class="subhead">I received the first unit with no issue,</span></br></p>however after opening it and setting it up there was a line down the right side of the screen from top to bottom. After contacting Samsung, they told me to contact Amazon who put me in touch with the actual seller. Great people, highly recommend the seller. They sent me a replacement unit and arranged for the defective unit to be picked up at the same time.
After unboxing and setting up the second unit I turn it on to find there are 6 purple spots about a foot up from the bottom of the screen. So far Samsung Support has told me to make sure there isn't something reflecting on it (there isn't) and asked for the software version (its up to date). I contacted the seller as well and they are working with me, making sure all protective layers have been removed (they have) and waiting on next steps. Again, the seller has been great throughout this ordeal.
<i><b>Save yourself some time and many headaches and avoid this model.</i></b> I do not thing it is ready for the consumer.</p></b>
