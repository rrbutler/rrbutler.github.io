		<p>American health care company UnitedHealth Group is rolling out a self-administered coronavirus test.
		The news shared with ESSENCE this week comes as America surpasses both China and Italy for confirmed coronavirus cases.</p>

On Monday White House officials alluded to a game changing patient-administered COVID-19 test process during a daily coronavirus briefing.

      The COVID-19 pandemic presents the health care system with extraordinary challenges that need to be addressed quickly.
			 While working on the front lines of our clinical care facilities in Washington state, Dr. Tu
			 saw an opportunity to improve COVID-19 testing and rallied the expertise and resources of UnitedHealth Group
			  to complete the study in less than one week, said Ken Ehlert, chief scientific officer of UnitedHealth Group.
			 This is one of many ways we’re working across UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare to combat COVID-19 by
			 providing the best care for patients, supporting the health care workforce, and enabling the health care system with new insights and solutions.

      The funny thing is we actually discovered each other strengths once we opened the savings account. We were able to determine that I [Lavern] have innate budgeting skills and Cynee has a great eye for quality elements needed to execute the mission.
			These roles are crucial for running a business and go hand in hand. In a nutshell,  Cynee tells me what is needed as far as inventory,
			and I give the budget or allowance to get the best for our brand within limits. We also try to keep up with the latest version of what
			our industry has to offer. We did research on why some businesses fail, and we learned that overspending was one of the top reasons.
			I am able to keep us on track and determine when we might have to hold off on making a purchase, and remind Cynee that “emergency funds
			is never an option, unless it is an emergency!
